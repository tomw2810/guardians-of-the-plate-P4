This is a full-stack framework project built using HTML, CSS, Python, Javascript and Django, This is a fictional restaurant website where you can view information on about the restaurant and book a table should you wish. It allows you to create a new booking, edit a current booking and delete a booking. 

## Guardians of the Plate UI

Just like any typical restaurant with a decent website attached to its name I wanted to ensure that the customer has the functionality that I would expect should I wish to do the same on a real world site.

## Target Audience

* Everyone who enjoys a cheap meal
* Group gatherings as the fictional restaurant has a large outside area which people can converse should they wish in large parties.
* Ages 20-40 or 60 + as most younger people as well as older people like to have an option for saving money for different reasons.
